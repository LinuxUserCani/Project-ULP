# Project-ULP
ULP: Unified Linux Programs. AppImage-like but uses shared libraries for smaller application sizes. Mainly composed of Bash scripts.

# What is a ULX file?
.ULX executables are self-extracting tarballs that installs the required libraries system-wide, then executes the binary inside the file.

# What is the goal of this?
My main purpose with this project is to prove that Bash isn't just a basic scripting language,and it can be a complex programming language when needed.
I'll try to keep this project BASH-only as much as I can.

# BIG WARNING
This project isnt complete yet, and nothing actually runs, so dont try to execute any scripts, it might break your system.
