# Project-ULP
ULP: Unified Linux Programs. AppImage-like but uses shared libraries for smaller application sizes. Mainly composed of Bash scripts.
This repository consists of the required tools to convert any compiled binary tarball that has an executable in it to a .ULP executable.
.ULP executables are self-extracting tarballs that installs the required libraries system-wide, then executes the binary inside the file.
My main purpose with this project is to prove that Bash isn't just a basic scripting language,and it can be a complex programming language when needed.
I'll try to keep this project BASH-only as much as I can.
